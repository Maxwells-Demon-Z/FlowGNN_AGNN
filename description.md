## Algorithm of AGNN

To make AGNN fit the structure of FlowGNN, it is essential to analyze the algorithm. 

First, several 

Support there are $N$ nodes and $M$ edges in a graph, the dimensions of the node feature and the node embedding are $F$ and $D$. 

The algorithm of AGNN can be represented as  
$\mathbf{H}_0=\mathbf{MLP}(\mathbf{X})$  
$for\ loop:$
$\ \ $

where $\mathbf{X}\in \mathbf{R}^{N\times F}$, $\mathbf{X}$ is
