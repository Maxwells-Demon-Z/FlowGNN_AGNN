# TrackGNN  

The project is to design an accelerator to process data loaded from colliders, which can determine the authenticity of tracks.  
The design of accelerator bases on the article of FlowGNN, and refers to the open-source code - https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13103 and https://github.com/sharc-lab/FlowGNN.  
The algorithm of processing bases on the article of sPhenix, and refers to the open-source code - https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06111 and https://bitbucket.org/dtyu/trigger-detection-pipeline.  
If there is any issue or question, please contact Hanqing Zhang by the email hanqing.zhang@zju.edu.cn.  

To use this project, you can modify parameters in the file './TrackGNN/main/generate.py', and execute it.  The file will exact files from the folder './TrackGNN/src_files/'. All the files which are needed to use for accelerator building can be generated in the folder './TrackGNN/prj/' automatically for a while.
